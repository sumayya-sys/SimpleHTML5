# SimpleHTML5

A multipage static site template using semantic HTML5 and responsive CSS3 layouts.

## Features
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive CSS3 design

## Version 1 (root directory)
- What you had last week
- Basic static HTML5 and CSS3 files

To see it in action use "Go Live" & open `index.html` in a web browser. 

## Version 2 (v2 directory)
- Improved layout and styling
- Enhanced styling with CSS3 Flexbox and Grid
- Improved accessibility features with switches for dark mode
- Hero area
- Article sections with images and captions

To see it in action use "Go Live" & open `v2/` in a web browser.

You should be able to combine the features from v2 with your code from 
last week.

### Task: About Page Issue

- What is wrong with the About page? Fix it. 
- What would be a better fix?



## Version 3 (v3-src directory)
- Optional advanced version using Jinja2 templating and Python build script
- Static site generation using Jinja2 templates
- Automated build process with Python script
- Modular template structure for easy maintenance
- Output static files in build directory  

### Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and Jinja2 installed.
2. Run the build script to generate the static site:
   ```bash
   python build-v3.py
   ```  
3. The generated static files will be available in the `build` directory.

### GitHub Pages deploy workflow (disabled)

A GitHub Actions workflow to build v3 and publish the `build/` directory to GitHub Pages is included at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`, but it is intentionally disabled.

To activate the deploy workflow:
1. Edit `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` and remove the line `if: false`
 (or change it to the trigger you want).
2. Commit and push the change to the repository's default branch (e.g. `main`).
3. (Optional) In the repository Settings → Actions, ensure Actions are enabled 
for the repository.
4. In the repository Settings → Pages, you can confirm the site is served via 
"GitHub Actions" after the workflow runs successfully.

Once activated, the workflow will:
- Install Python and Jinja2
- Run `python build-v3.py`
- Upload the contents of `build/` and deploy them to GitHub Pages

If you want to test without publishing, keep `if: false`, or change the `on:` 
triggers to a branch you use for testing.


# Tasks for You to Implement 

- Choose your own order to implement these features!
- add make sure you are doing them in the correct folder (the base folder  
or v3-src)


## Add another page

Create a new HTML page (e.g., `services.html`) in the appropriate directory.

## Task: Add a YouTube Video Embed

Embed a responsive YouTube video in your webpage.
### Pointers:
1. **HTML Structure**
   - Use a `<figure>` element to contain the video and caption
   - Inside the `<figure>`, add a `<div>` with a class (e.g., `video-container`) to hold the iframe
   - Add an `<iframe>` element with the YouTube embed URL which you can get from the "Share" -> "Embed" option on YouTube
   - Set the `width` and `height` attributes to `100%` for responsiveness   
   - Add a `<figcaption>` for the video description


 
## Task: Add a diagrams with Mermaid.js

Great for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more.

Add the Mermaid.js library to your HTML file by including the following script tag in the `<head>` section: 

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
```

Then add the diagram where you like in the main content area:it will work 
best in the art
```html
<figure>
    <div class="mermaid">
        graph TD;
        A-->B;
        B-->C;
    </div>
    <figcaption>Simple Mermaid Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
```
You can use any Mermaid syntax to create different types of diagrams.
Visit https://mermaid.js.org/ and use the Free version to design your diagrams.

## Task: Hero Image with Text Overlay
Create a hero section with a full-width background image and centered text overlay.
### Pointers:
     You already have a hero section in `index.html` with the class `hero`.
     1. Pick a high-quality image and add it to the `assets/images/` directory.
     2. In your CSS file, set the `.hero` class to use the image as a background:
        - Use `background-image: url('path/to/your/image.jpg');`
        - Set `background-size: cover;` and `background-position: center;`   
        - Set a fixed height for the hero section (e.g., `height: 400px;`)
        3. Center the text overlay using flexbox:
        - `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: 
        


## Task: Mobile Menu Toggle

Add a hamburger menu button that shows/hides a navigation menu on smaller screens.

### Pointers:

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Add a `<button>` element with id `menu-button` in your header
   - Add an id `nav-menu` to your existing `<nav>` element
   - Use the `aria-label` and `aria-expanded` attributes for accessibility

2. **CSS Styling**
   - Hide the button by default with `display: none`
   - Use a media query `@media (max-width: 768px)` to show it on mobile
   - Position the menu absolutely when it appears on mobile
   - Add a `.active` CSS class that shows/hides the menu (use `max-height` or `display` to toggle visibility)
   - Add a smooth `transition` for the menu opening/closing animation

3. **JavaScript Event Listeners**
   - Listen for clicks on the menu button and toggle the `.active` class on the nav menu
   - Update the `aria-expanded` attribute when the menu opens/closes
   - Add a click listener to all nav links so the menu closes when a user navigates
   - Bonus: Close the menu if the user clicks outside of it (use `event.target` and `.contains()`)

4. **Testing**
   - Test on desktop (button should be hidden)
   - Test on mobile/tablet (button should appear)
   - Test that clicking the button toggles the menu
   - Test that clicking a nav link closes the menu

#### Hints:
- Use `document.getElementById()` and `document.querySelectorAll()` to select elements
- Use `classList.toggle()` and `classList.remove()` to manage the `.active` class
- Use `addEventListener('click', ...)` to handle user interactions
